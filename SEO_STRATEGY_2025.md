## Technical SEO Requirements

### Critical Technical Fixes (Priority 1)

#### 1. Create robots.txt

**File:** `/public/robots.txt`

```
# TrustYourInbox robots.txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /login
Disallow: /signup

# Sitemaps
Sitemap: https://trustyourinbox.com/sitemap.xml
Sitemap: https://trustyourinbox.com/sitemap-tools.xml
Sitemap: https://trustyourinbox.com/sitemap-blog.xml

# Crawl-delay for aggressive bots
User-agent: AhrefsBot
Crawl-delay: 10

User-agent: SemrushBot
Crawl-delay: 10
```

---

#### 2. Create XML Sitemaps

**Primary Sitemap:** `/public/sitemap.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<sitemapindex xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <sitemap>
    <loc>https://trustyourinbox.com/sitemap-pages.xml</loc>

    <loc>https://trustyourinbox.com/sitemap-blog.xml</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-01-01</lastmod>
  </sitemap>
</sitemapindex>
```

**Tools Sitemap:** `/public/sitemap-tools.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>

    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.9</priority>
  </url>
  <!-- Add all 11+ tools -->
</urlset>
```

**Implementation:** Use Next.js 15 app router sitemap generation

```typescript
// app/sitemap.ts
export default function sitemap() {
  return [
    {
      url: "https://trustyourinbox.com",
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: "daily",
      priority: 1,
    },
    {
      url: "https://trustyourinbox.com/tools/dmarc-analyzer",
      lastModified: new Date(),
      changeFrequency: "weekly",
      priority: 0.9,
    },
    // ... all tools
  ];
}
```

---

#### 3. Canonical URLs

**Status:** ✅ Already implemented in layout.tsx

```typescript
alternates: {
  canonical: "/",
}
```

**Action:** Ensure all pages have proper canonical tags

---

#### 4. Structured Data (Schema.org)

**Current Implementation:** ✅ Good foundation

- SoftwareApplication schema
- Organization schema

**Enhancements Needed:**

**Add FAQPage Schema** (for all tool pages)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a DMARC record?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A DMARC record is a DNS TXT record that specifies how email receivers should handle messages that fail SPF or DKIM authentication checks. It helps prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Add HowTo Schema** (for implementation guides)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HowTo",
  "name": "How to Implement DMARC in 2025",
  "step": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "name": "Step 1: Configure SPF",
      "text": "Publish SPF record in DNS...",
      "url": "https://trustyourinbox.com/guides/implement-dmarc#step-1"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Add WebApplication Schema** (for each tool)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebApplication",
  "name": "DMARC Analyzer",
  "applicationCategory": "SecurityApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web Browser",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "USD"
  }
}
```

**Add AggregateRating Schema** (when you have reviews)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "TrustYourInbox DMARC Platform",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.9",
    "reviewCount": "127"
  }
}
```

---

#### 5. Core Web Vitals Optimization

**Current Status:** Good (using Speed Insights)

**Enhancements:**

1. **Lazy Load Below-Fold Content**

   ```typescript
   // ✅ Already implemented with next/dynamic
   const ProductShowcase = dynamic(
     () => import("@/components/sections/ProductShowcase")
   );
   ```

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Use Next.js Image component for all images
   - Implement WebP with JPEG fallback
   - Add width/height to prevent CLS
   - Lazy load images below fold

3. **Font Optimization**

   ```typescript
   // ✅ Already using localFont with display: "optional"
   const averta = localFont({
     display: "optional", // Good for performance
   });
   ```

4. **Critical CSS**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Already implemented
   const criticalCSS = fs.readFileSync(
     path.join(process.cwd(), "src/app/critical.css")
   );
   ```

---

#### 6. Mobile Optimization

**Test on:**

- iPhone (375px, 414px)
- Android (360px, 412px)
- Tablet (768px, 1024px)

**Ensure:**

- ✅ Responsive design (likely already good with Tailwind)
- ✅ Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum)
- ✅ Readable font sizes (16px minimum)
- ✅ No horizontal scroll

---

#### 7. HTTPS & Security Headers

**Verify:**

- ✅ HTTPS enabled
- Add security headers (if not already present):

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/:path*",
        headers: [
          {
            key: "X-Frame-Options",
            value: "DENY",
          },
          {
            key: "X-Content-Type-Options",
            value: "nosniff",
          },
          {
            key: "Referrer-Policy",
            value: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

---

#### 8. Page Speed Targets

**Current:** Unknown (need to measure)

**Targets:**

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay):** < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** < 0.1
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint):** < 1.8s
- **TTI (Time to Interactive):** < 3.9s

**Tools:**

- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Lighthouse
- WebPageTest

**Example for /tools/dmarc-analyzer:**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is a DMARC record?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A DMARC record is a DNS TXT record published at _dmarc.yourdomain.com that tells email receivers how to handle messages that fail SPF or DKIM authentication. It helps prevent email spoofing, phishing, and domain impersonation attacks."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do I check my DMARC record?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You can check your DMARC record by using our free DMARC Analyzer tool. Simply paste your DMARC record or enter your domain name, and we'll analyze it for syntax errors, policy recommendations, and compliance issues."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What does p=none mean in DMARC?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "p=none is the monitoring-only DMARC policy. It means email receivers should not take any action on messages that fail DMARC authentication, but should send reports to the domain owner. This is the recommended starting policy when first implementing DMARC."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the difference between p=quarantine and p=reject?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "p=quarantine tells email receivers to send failed messages to spam/junk folders, while p=reject instructs receivers to block the messages entirely. p=reject is the strictest and most secure policy, but requires careful implementation to avoid blocking legitimate email."
      }
    }
  ]
