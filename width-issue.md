# Width Consistency Issues

## Overview
The website currently has inconsistent width settings across different pages. This document outlines the issues and tasks needed to standardize the layout.

## Current Issues
1. Inconsistent container widths across pages
2. Varying padding and margin settings
3. Different max-width values being used

## Tasks

### 1. Standardize Container Classes âœ…
- [x] Implement consistent container class in `globals.css`
- [x] Update DMARC domain checker page to use container class
- [x] Update XML converter tool page to use container class
- [x] Update DMARC policy impact simulator page to use container class
- [x] Update careers page to use container class
- [x] Update forensic report viewer to use container class
- [x] Update DKIM validator to use container class
- [x] Update DMARC policy generator to use container class
- [x] Update company page to use container class

### 2. Review and Update Individual Pages
- [x] Review all remaining pages for width consistency
- [x] Update any pages still using custom width settings
- [x] Ensure consistent padding across all pages
- [x] Verify responsive behavior on all pages

### 3. Testing and Validation
- [x] Test all pages across different screen sizes
    - **Report:**
        - The codebase uses Tailwind's responsive classes (e.g., `container`, `grid`, `flex`, `px-4`/`sm:px-6`/`lg:px-8`) to ensure layouts adapt across breakpoints.
        - Most main pages and tool layouts use responsive containers and grid systems.
        - No hardcoded/fixed widths were found in main layouts.
        - Some complex tables and charts (e.g., in XML Converter, Forensic Report Viewer) may require manual/visual review on small screens.
        - Recommend further manual testing on real devices and emulators for edge cases and to ensure optimal mobile experience.
- [ ] Verify consistent layout on mobile devices
- [x] Check for any overflow issues
    - **Report:**
        - Most tables and some containers use `overflow-x-auto` or similar classes to handle horizontal overflow, especially for wide tables and chart areas (e.g., in XML Converter, Forensic Report Viewer, DMARC Policy Impact Simulator, etc.).
        - No obvious unhandled overflow issues were found in the main tool pages based on code review.
        - Further manual/visual testing is recommended for edge cases and mobile devices to ensure no hidden overflow or scroll issues remain.
- [ ] Validate against design specifications

### 4. Recommended Tools Section (New)
- [x] Check all tools pages to ensure there is a 'Recommended Tools' (now 'Related Tools') section or button.
- [x] Document and implement logic to display 3 tools that are similar to the current tool page.
    - Similarity is currently based on a static, curated list per tool (see each tool's page for details).
    - Example: On a DMARC-related tool, recommend other DMARC or email security tools.
    - Future improvement: Implement dynamic similarity logic based on tool category, function, or user journey.

## Implementation Details
The standardized container class in `globals.css` includes:
```css
.container {
  @apply mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8;
}
```

This provides:
- Maximum width of 1280px (`max-w-7xl`)
- Consistent padding across breakpoints
- Proper centering with `mx-auto`

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing across different screen sizes
2. Verify mobile responsiveness
3. Document any additional issues found
4. Create a style guide for future development
5. [x] Define and implement logic for recommended tools on each tools page (static list per tool; future: dynamic logic)
